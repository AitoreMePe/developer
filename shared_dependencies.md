Based on the user's prompt, the shared dependencies between the files could be:

1. Python Libraries: These are the libraries that will be used across multiple files. Some of these could be pandas, numpy, torch, transformers, csv, os, etc.

2. GPT4All-13B-snoozy.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin: This is the GPT model file that will be used in the "model.py" file for creating the neural database and in "interaction.py" for interacting with the database.

3. Data Files: The CSV files containing the game and player data will be used in "data_processing.py" and "csv_handler.py". In the future, other file formats may also be used, which will be handled by "file_handler.py".

4. Configurations: The "config.py" file will contain various configurations that will be used across multiple files. These could include paths to the data files, the model file, and various parameters for the model and data processing.

5. Functions: There will be several functions that will be used across multiple files. For example, "data_processing.py" might have functions for cleaning and preprocessing the data, which will be used in "main.py". Similarly, "model.py" might have functions for training and using the model, which will also be used in "main.py".

6. Database: The "database.py" file will contain the code for the neural database. This will be used in "main.py" for creating the database and in "interaction.py" for interacting with it.

7. Utilities: The "utils.py" file will contain various utility functions that will be used across multiple files. These could include functions for reading and writing files, handling errors, logging, etc.
