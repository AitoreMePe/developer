The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Next.js**: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. **React**: Next.js is built on top of React, so React components and hooks are used throughout the application files.

3. **TypeScript**: TypeScript is used in all the `.tsx` files for type checking and improved developer experience.

4. **Package.json**: This file contains the list of project dependencies and scripts, which are shared across all the project files.

5. **tsconfig.json**: This file contains the TypeScript configuration options that are used across all the TypeScript files in the project.

6. **_app.tsx**: This file is used to initialize pages. It has shared dependencies with all the pages in the application.

7. **_document.tsx**: This file is used to augment the application's html and body tags. It has shared dependencies with all the pages in the application.

8. **globals.css**: This file contains global styles that are used across all the pages in the application.

9. **favicon.ico**: This file is used in the _document.tsx file to set the favicon for the application.

10. **.gitignore**: This file contains the list of files and directories that Git should ignore. It affects all the files in the project.

11. **README.md**: This file contains the documentation for the project. It doesn't directly share dependencies with other files, but it should be updated as the project evolves.

Note: As the application is not fully defined, the specific exported variables, data schemas, id names of DOM elements, message names, and function names cannot be determined at this point.
